# About Slash

<div className="markdown">

Slash is the official mascot of Docusaurus. You will find different variations of her throughout the website, whether she is moving fast on her scooter or writing documentation at her standing desk. At Facebook, we have actual Slash plushies -- and you never know, you may see these plushies at various events and conferences in the future.

## The Birth of Slash

![Birth of Slash](/static/img/slash-birth.png)

The team sat in a conference room trying to come up with a name for the project. Dinosaurs became a theme, finally landing on Docusaurus, combining documentation with those many dinosaurs that end in "saurus". Of course, we needed a logo for our new project. Eric sat down and designed a logo that was quite beyond the norm of our normal open source project logos, but yet was just so awesome, we had to use it. We needed a name for this cute Docusaur. "Marky" for markdown? "Docky" for documentation? No, "Slash" for the normal way someone starts code documentation in many programming languages `//` or `/\*` or `///`. And Slash was born.
